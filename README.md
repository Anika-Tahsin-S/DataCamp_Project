| SL | Project        | Description           |
| ------------- | ------------- |-------------|
| 1. | `The Hottest Topics in Machine Learning`     | Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS) is one of the top machine learning conferences in the world where groundbreaking work is published. In this Project, a large collection of NIPS research papers from the past decade to discover the latest trends in machine learning is analyzed. The techniques used here to handle large amounts of data can be applied to other text datasets as well. | 
| 2. | `Naïve Bees: Image Loading and Processing`      |  In this Project, the Python image library Pillow to load and manipulate image data is used. Also shown the common transformations of images and how to build them into a pipeline.     |
| 3. | `Naïve Bees: Predict Species from Images` |  This project is the second part of a series of projects that walk through working with image data, building classifiers using traditional techniques, and leveraging the power of deep learning for computer vision.     |
